Features
--------
- **Interactive**: Use keyboard or mouse to scroll/expand objects.
- **Colors**
- **Responsive**: Adapt to the terminal dimensions. Very long text values are
  wrapped on several lines.
- **Cross-platform**: Windows, Linux, MacOS.
- **Small**: ~0.7MB all included. Zero dependencies.
- The output is displayed inline with the previous commands. Meaning you can
  still see the json after leaving json-tui.
- *(Vim users): Also support `j`/`k` for navigation.*
- **Table view**: Turn arrays of objects into tables. <details>
